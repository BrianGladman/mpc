Source code from the git repository
-----------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the git repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtool packages.
Execute:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Required versions:
* autoconf >= 2.61
* automake >= 1.11.6
* libtool >= 2.4.3

Creating a new release
----------------------

1) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
   README, src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h (remove suffix "dev" in
   MPC_VERSION_STRING) and Makefile.vc.
   Check there are no compiler warnings with -Wuninitialized -fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all.
2) Verify that the ABI version in src/Makefile.am is correct.
   Check that the executables are not read-only
   (https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/mpc-discuss/2020-June/001539.html)
   Replace the two occurrences of /gnu/store/.../bin/sh in build-aux/ltmain.sh
   by /bin/sh.
3) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
   version numbers of gmp and mpfr in configure.ac, README and
   doc/mpc.texi are correct (and check that make and make check work
   with these minimal versions).
4) Execute "autoreconf -vfi; touch doc/mpc.texi; make distcheck".
   This updates the files in build-aux and the date and version number in
   doc/version.texi and creates the tarball for distribution.
5) Upload to GNU ftp server.
6) Update the web page on the server.
7) Create a git tag:
   git tag VERSION
   git push --tags
8) After the release, update the version number in configure.ac, README,
   src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h and Makefile.vc.
9) Commit the changes to git.
